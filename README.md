 ### 📦 Project name

 **SentinelSecrets**

*🔐 Secret Scanner for CI/CD & Git Hooks*

SentinelSecrets is an open-source tool for preventing secret leaks
(API keys, tokens, passwords) in Git repositories and CI/CD.The project integrates directly into the development process via Git hooks, blocking a commit if a secret is detected in it.

### 🎯 Project Summary

A tool that automatically prevents secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) from leaking before code is pushed to the repository:

- Checks git diffs before committing

- Uses regular expressions + entropy analysis

- Suitable for local development and CI/CD

- Generates reports in JSON and Markdown

- Has a REST API with OpenAPI (Swagger)

### ✅ Benefits and Problems Solved

- **Leak Prevention:** Stops secrets from leaking into public and corporate repositories.
- **Risk Mitigation (Shift Left Security):** Security is checked at the coding stage, not after deployment.
- **Audit Automation:** Report generation in JSON format allows for easy integration into corporate security dashboards.

### Architecture

- scanner.py — signatures and search logic

- entropy.py — random secret detection

- git_utils.py — working with git diff

- api.py — REST API

### Threats this addresses

- API key leaks to public repositories

- Cloud account compromise

- SOC2/ISO 27001 compliance violations

- Supply chain attacks

### 🧪 How to run tests

~~~bash
pip install pytest
pytest -v
